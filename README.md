This code simulates system-level satellite communication networks with dense constellations. It was developed to investigate coexistence between primary (incumbent) and secondary satellite systems, where the secondary system is required to operate under interference-protection constraints to safeguard the primary system. This work originated from research conducted during Eunsun Kim's PhD studies.
To support further research and encourage continued investigation in this area, a simplified subset of the original codebase is released here for public use.
